# socket-programming

This project is a socket-programming project that provides group chatting platform and Battleship Game that abele to be accessed by multiple clients.

To compile the program write 'javac -d bin *.java' and to run write 'java -cp bin Driver' as a command on the Terminal.

Once it done you will be able to chose wether you wants to playt a battleship game or chatting with your friends.

Battleship Game:
After choosing to play you'll be asked whether you wanted to be the host or just connect. 
Once finished, as host you'll get the ip and port addresss of your server and it will be used for your opponents player to connect to your game!
Once the opponent connect the game by inputting the ip adn port then both of you will able to play the Game by guessing the coordinate of the ship!
If you hit the ship, you may goes on guessing, otherwise, the opponets will move. You'll do this iteratively until one of the player has all the ship sank.
You'll win if you have ship left on your board!

Chatting:
In case you are choosing to chat with your friend, after choosing chat you may need to choose connect other than host.
However there must be a server ran first before you ran your programs as a client. 
After ranning the host you and your friends may get the ip and ports from there to connect to the group.
You just need to put in the host ip's, port's and your username to join the group chat! and so do your friends.
After your friends coming in, everyone are able to see each others messages as if it in a WhatsApp Group.

Enjoy! Thank you!
